  # Fix Row Level Security Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policies to allow proper access for authenticated operations
    - Ensure INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, and DELETE operations work correctly
    - Maintain security while allowing application functionality

  2. Policy Changes
    - Update customers table policies
    - Update related table policies for consistency
    - Ensure proper access control
